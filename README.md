## How to host sbxd on GitHub Pages

If you host sbxd on GitHub Pages, the recent 3 posts will be automatically fetched from Scrapbox every day (00:00 UTC) by GitHub Actions. The following tutorial explains the details of the setup.

Click [Use this template](https://github.com/shoya140/sbxd/generate) button in this page and create a new repository. The `Include all branches` option must be turned on since we need a branch named `contents`.

Go to the Settings tab and activate GitHub Pages. Select `GitHub Actions (Beta)` as the source and leave other fields blank.

Go to the Actions tab and click `Run workflow` in the "Fetch all data..." workflow. This action needs to be manually performed once. Then "Deploy Next.js site to page" including fetching the recent 3 posts will be performed every day.
